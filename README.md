# Solving Fizz Buzz using pytorch

## Dependencies
- pytorch  
- numpy  

Use `pip` to install what you need. Find more info about PyTorch [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/index.html).

## Usage
Just type `python FizzBuzz.py` in the terminal :)

## Result
Only get about 93% accuracy on test set, so I think I lose the job :(

## Story
You can find the Fizz-Buzz story [here](http://joelgrus.com/2016/05/23/fizz-buzz-in-tensorflow/) and the author's code [here](https://github.com/joelgrus/fizz-buzz-tensorflow). Hope you can enjoy it.
